# Data Ingestion Workshop Notes

## Importance of Data Ingestion
Data ingestion is the critical first step in the data engineering process, involving collecting data from various sources and moving it into a system where it can be stored, processed, and analyzed. Efficient data ingestion is essential for timely and accurate data analysis, impacting decision-making and business strategy.

## Data Formats
Understanding data formats is crucial for data ingestion. Formats like JSON, CSV, and XML are common, each with specific use cases. Knowledge of these formats allows for effective data collection, storage, and processing, facilitating seamless integration and analysis.

## Limitations
Data ingestion processes can be limited by hardware capacity and network bandwidth. Strategies to overcome these limitations include optimizing data formats, using data compression, and implementing efficient data transfer protocols, ensuring data is moved and processed efficiently.

## Incremental Loading
Incremental loading refers to updating data warehouses with only new or changed data since the last load, enhancing efficiency and reducing resource consumption. This approach is vital for managing large datasets and ensuring data freshness without overloading systems.

## Schema Management
Schema management involves defining and controlling database structures. Effective schema management ensures that data is organized logically, supports data integrity and quality, and accommodates changes in data structure over time without significant disruption.

## Normalization
Data normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves structuring a database according to normalization rules to achieve a clean, efficient database design, facilitating easier data analysis and reporting.

## Tools and Libraries
Familiarity with tools and libraries for data ingestion, such as Apache NiFi, Airflow, and pandas, is crucial. These tools support various aspects of data ingestion, from extraction and transformation to loading, helping build scalable and reliable data pipelines.
