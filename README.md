**Today I:**

- Set-up GCP account through CLI and made a new project in Google cloud.
- Installed Docker and Docker Compose.
- Installed Terraform
- Prepared a working environment for the course
- Successfuly created a few trial containers.
  - Made Dockerfile
    - Runs python 3.1
    - Installs Pandas
    - ENTRYPOINT at 'python', 'pipeline.py'
  - Created pipeline (pipeline.py)
    - imports sys and pandas

I am haing a bit of difficulty with some of the python code,but the container builds successfully.  

**Next steps are:**
- make docker file behave as instructed
- GCP infrastructure with Terraform.
