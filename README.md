# Claytor's Log

## Module 1: Introduction & Prerequisites

### 1A: Docker + Postgres

#### 12/20/2023 - Setup

- Set-up GCP account through CLI and made a new project in Google cloud.
- Installed Docker and Docker Compose.
- Prepared a working environment for the course
- Successfuly created a few trial containers.
  - Made Dockerfile
    - Runs python 3.1
    - Installs Pandas
    - ENTRYPOINT at 'python', 'pipeline.py'
  - Created pipeline (pipeline.py)
    - imports sys and pandas
- Successfully built and tested a container that takes an argument and gives an expected result! üòÇ
- Basic workflow notes
  - Pull docker image: `docker pull 'name_of_container'`
  - Build container: `docker build -t 'name_of_container' .`
  - Run docker `docker run -it 'name_of_container'`

#### 12/21/2023 - Ingestion configuration

- Worked on ingesting data into docker file
- Struggled with port configuration.  Couldn't get my data to where it needed to be.  The issue was that my local installation of pgAdmin was already running on the default port.  I had to I'll handle it tomorrow

#### 12/22/2023 - First attempt at Docker Network

- Was able to successfully create postgres container.
- Explored container with pgcli
- Used sqlalchemy inside of a jupyter notebook to successfuly ingest data to postgres container.  Verified results with pgcli

#### 12/23/2023 - Lots of progress and hard lessons learned

- Created pgAdmin container and accessed it through localhost
- Attempted to setup docker network for both pgadmin and postgres. Kept running into issues
  - Found the source of the errors was from white space in code being run in terminal
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **CHECK YOUR BASH COMMANDS IN EDITOR FOR WHITESPACE BEFORE PASTING INTO TERMINAL** üò§
- accidentally deleted postgres container with ingested data  ü•¥.  Didn't take too long to recreate, but it would have sucked if that happened with a larger database.  Not too much trouble to run the notebook again.  Since I'm using parquet files, It makes me kind of nervous not to be able to see the progress from within the notebook . . . I'll probably need a better monitoring strategy in the future.
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **MAKE SURE YOU SHUT YOUR CONTAINERS DOWN PROPERLY OR SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES!!!**
- I was able to get the containers networkd and talking together.  I'm so stoked I figured it out!
- Converted ipynb to python script using `jupyter nbconvert` to make a 'poboy' ingestion script.
  - Used argparse library to parse arguments to containers
  - This is referred to as a **top-level code environment**  and required a main block `if __name__ == '__main__':`.  I dont exactly know the broader context of why its needed here, but the instructor said it was needed for things we want to run as scripts.
- Dropped taxi data from container to test script
- I was running the script bind and it was erroring out.  Went down a rabbit hole for error handling.
- OMG IT WORKED!!!!!  I successfully ingested data to my containers with a python script!  It ain't much, but its mine!

#### **12/27/2023** - Making an ingestion container to apply ingestion script to docker network

- Fixed python script do download data to the intended local directory
- Continued to run into confusion about local network vs. docker network.  I got it ironed out.
- I was able to create a container that:
  - connected to docker network containing postgres and pgadmin container
  - installed dependencies to run python ingestion script
  - programatically downloaded local parque file and ingested data to networked postgress database.
  - confirmed success with pgAdmin container.
- started working on docker-compose.yml file to spin up containers programatically.
- YAY!!! docker compose works!

#### **12/28/2023** - Adding another table to postgres container and practicing SQL skills

- Created jupyter notebook to inspect and ingest NY taxi zone information to postgres container
- Practiced some basic queries on database.

### 1B: Docker and SQL

--------------------

#### **12/29/2023** - Introduction to Terraform Concepts & PCP Pre-Requisites

- Began setting up teraform with GCP
- Created a service account and generated keys
- Authenticated application credentials with SKD using OAUTH
- IAM enabled
  - view
  - storage Object Admin
  - Storage Admin
  - Big Query Admin
- Enabled IAM Service Account Credentials API
- Installed Terraform
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **BE VERY SURE OF WHAT YOU'RE DEPLOYING BEFORE YOU DEPLOY IT üî•üí≤üî•**
- Created terraform directory and required files
  - .terraform-version
    - specifies what version of terraform to use
  - main.tf
    - defines configuration of resources
  - README.md
  - variables.tf
    - stores the variables that get used in the main.tf
    - these are passed at runtime 

#### **01/02/2024** - Creating GCP Infrastructure: Initializing configuration and importing plugins

-Started to work with terraform files.

#### **01/03/2024**

- Edited main.tf and variables.tf to work in concert. 
- Created and then destroyed bucket on gcp.  Great success!
  - terraform init
  - terraform plan
  - terraform apply
  - terraform destroy
- Made sure to add appropriate entries for .gitignore

#### **01/15/2024** - Created Ubuntu VM on GCP and Configured

- Generated ssh keys and imported public key to GCP admin.
- SSH into vm and ran htop to confirm machine was working!
- Used vim for editing readme because I'm a glutton for punishment.
- Installed anaconda on vm
- Installed docker on vm
- created ssh config file to ssh into vm locally
- Installed SSH extension for vscode
- Added user to docker group on vm to run without root
- Downloaded docker compose, made executable, and added to path variable
	- `chmod +x docker-compose`
	-  

#### **01/17/2024** - Finished setting up Cloud Environment

- generated ssh keys for github and cloned personal repo to vm
- installed devcontainer for class repo
- forwarded ports for jupyter and pgadmin
- installed terraform binary from website (wget, unzip, rm)
- transferred local gcp credentials to VM in .gcp directory using sftp and  put 
- set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environmental variable
- Activated service account credentials
- Tested terraform (plan/apply) on vm.
- Setup global user name and email on gitconfig
- Pushed changes to github from vm.
- NOTE: There is still a little wonkyness with port forwarding.  I'll need to iron that out later.

#### **01/24/2024** - Repeats

- Successfully modified all previously created code to run natively in my container.

#### **01/28/2024** - The reconing

- Finished and submitted my assessment for the first module.

## Module 2: Workflow Orchestration

#### **01/29/2024** - Introduction to Mage 

##### Notes on orchestration
- Mage and postgres will run in a docker image
- Archetecture
  - Extract 
    - Pull data from a source (API-NYC taxi data set)
  - Transform
    - Data cleaning, transformation, and partitioning.
  - Load
    - API to Mage, Mage to Postgres, GCS, BigQuery
- Orchestraton is the process of dependency management facilitated through automation.  The idea is to minimize manual work.  A good idea is to minimize as much work as possible.
  - The data orchestrator manages scheduling, triggering, monitoring, and resource allocation.
  - Every workflow requires sequential steps.  Porly sequenced transformations mess up your data

##### Notes on Mage

- Mage is an open-source ETL tool
  - projects
  - pipelines
  - blocks (sensors, conditionals, dynamics, webhooks, etc)
    - load
    - transform
    - export
  - Engineering best practices
    - In-line testing and debugging
    - Fully-features observability
      - transfomations in one place
    - DRY principles (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Core components of Mage
  - Projects
    - Pipelines (Called dags on other products)
      - Blocks (Bits of code that are run in your pipelines)
- Anatomy of a block
  - Imports
  - Decorator
  - Function (must return a dataframe)
  - Assertion

##### Setting up mage for the course

- Pulled repo
- Ran 
```bash 
cp dev.env .env
```
  - moves the dev environment to the .env to keep you from pushing secrets.
```bash
docker-compose up
```
to download the container in the exercise
- Stink!  I ran out of space on my vm.  Need to shut it down and give it more space.
- Okay, I'm back up. Gave myself 100 gb
- Woohoo!  Ran first pipeline in Mage!  Now I need to make my own!

#### **01/29/2024** - Making My First Pipeline in Mage 

- Edited `io_confit.yml` to add dev provile to inject local .env variables into docker container.  You can do this both in vscode and in mage.  The injection uses Jinga Templating
```yml
 # Development pipeline
 dev:
  POSTGRES_CONNECT_TIMEOUT: 10
  POSTGRES_DBNAME: "{{ env_var('POSTGRES_DBNAME') }}"
  POSTGRES_SCHEMA: "{{ env_var('POSTGRES_SCHEMA') }}"
  POSTGRES_USER: "{{ env_var('POSTGRES_USER') }}"
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "{{ env_var('POSTGRES_PASSWORD') }}"
  POSTGRES_HOST: "{{ env_var('POSTGRES_HOST') }}"
  POSTGRES_PORT: "{{ env_var('POSTGRES_PORT') }}"
```
Added a data loader to pipeline to test postgres connection.  Great success

![Alt text](images/data_loader.png)

#### **01/31/2024** - Slightly more advanced pipeline.
Worked on a new pipeline that pulls data, performs a light transformation, and writes it postgres
- Extract - Data Loader `load_api_data`
  - Created function to download taxi data and change the dtypes of the columns.
    - We need to map out the datatypes for pandas when loading .csv
    - we need to return the data as csv because that's how you pass frames between blocks in Mage
- Transform - Data Transformation Block `transform_taxi_data`
  - There is some wonkyness in the data (such that there are trips with 0 passengers)
  - We handle this with some pre-proccessing with a transformer.  
  - Added a `@test` decorator
- Load - Data Exporter block (python, postgres) 'taxi_data_to_postgres'
  - Takes data from last cell, opens connection to postgres, exports data to the indicated schema and drops it in.

WOOHOO, My first "local" ETL Pipeline!

#### **02/02/24** Configureing GCP with Mage

**SIDE Quiest: I made a bash script to**
  - start vm
  - pass the IP to my config file
  - mount a remote directory on my local machine
  - shutting down the vm when i'm finished working

``` bash
üöÄ Starting VM [VM_NAME]...

```
1) **Create GCP Bucket**
  - Go to google cloud storage
  - Create a bucket `claytor-mage`
  - Make sure "Enforce public access prevention on this bucket" is enabled
2) **Create Service Account for `claytor-mage**`
  - I set access to owner.  Its very permissive.  Would need to be more limiting in the future.
  - Download key as json
  - Copy it into the Mage project
3) **Create Service Volume**
  - created a volume `claytor-mage`
4) **Authentication**
  - Edit `io_config.yaml` to add gcp credentials
  - Delete all but these lines undder `google`
  
  ```yaml
  GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACC_KEY_FILEPATH: "/path/to/your/service/account/key.json"
  GOOGLE_LOCATION: US # Optional
  ```
5) **Big Query**
- Manually Added `titanic_clean`.csv to my bucket.

6) **Test Pipeline** `big_query_test`
- Create a pipeline in Mage with a sql data loader pointed at BigQuery.
- Include a simple sql query to test the connection

6) **Test GCP**
- Edit pipeline (`big_query_test`) to remove test sql data loader block
- Make new python Data Loader
  - Change 
    ```python
    bucket_name = 'claytor-mage'
    object_key = 'titanic_clean.csv'
    ``` 

#### **02/03/2024** - API to GCS

- Created new pipeline `api_to_gcs`
- Draged `load_api_data` loader that was previously completed into `api_to_gcs`
- Dragged `transform_taxi_data` transformner that was previously completed into `api_to_gcs`
- Connected the two in the tree view
- Created a Python data exporter `taxi_to_gcs_parquet`
  - Updated `bucket_name` and `object_key=ny_taxi_data.parquet`.
- Executed all upstream blocks
  - IT WORKED!
- It's not best practice to write to a single parquet file, especially if dealing wiht large amounts of data.  So we will add another block to partioition by date.
  - sometimes dates represent a "best practice" scenario for partitioning.
  - added a generic python data loader called `taxi_to _gcs_partitioned_parquet`.
  - remove connection to previous block and associate it with the previous block `transform_taxi_data` so that they execute in parallel
    - in this case, we have to define credentials manually and us the pyarrow library to partion data.
    - at the beginning of the .py script add
      ```python
      import pyarrow as pa
      import pyarrow.parquet as pq
      import os
      ```
    - We need to tell pyarrow where our credentials are. this goes under the first `if` statement.  the credentials are already set in Mage's config file, but we have to add it manually in this case.
      go to the terminal and type 
      ```bash 
      ls -la
      ``` 
      to find our credentials (`/home/src/claytor-mage.json`)

      ```bash
        if 'data_exporter' not in globals():
        from mage_ai.data_preparation.decorators import data_exporter

        os.environ['GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS'] = "/home/src/claytor-mage.json"

        bucket_name = 'claytor-mage'
        project_id = 'claytor-mage'

        table_name = 'nyc_taxi_data'

        root_path = f'{bucket_name}/{table_name}'
        @data_exporter
        def export_data(data, *args, **kwargs):
          # gives us the date as as string that pyarrow can use
          data['tpep_pickup_date'] = data['tpep_pickup_datetime'].dt.date
          # reads data into a pyarrow table with pandas
          table = pa.Table.from_pandas(data)
          # find google cloud storage object in pyarrow fs.
          # Authroizes using environment variable automatically
          gcs = pa.fs.GcsFileSystem()
          # Use parquet write to data set method to dataset.  This requires three arguents
          pq.write_to_dataset(
          #first argument is "table" which is a pyarrow table
          table,
          # second argument is "root_path"
          root_path=root_path,
          # third argument is a list "partition_cols" where the columns to partion on are indicated
          partition_cols = ['tpep_pickup_date'],
          # The last argument is the file system, which is the gcs file system
          filesystem=gcs
          )
          # This breaks our data up by date and writes to different parquet files. see results in bucket
          # this is how larger datasets are managed.  Doesn't make sense to write a 2gb dataset into one file
          # it would be really slow to read and write
        ```

#### **02/04/2024** GCT to BigQuery, Parameterized Execution, Backfills, Deploying Mage on GCP
---
##### GCS to BigQuery

The next part of the workflow is to move the data from cloud strage to BigQuery (olap database). This mirrors a tradational workflow in DE where you take data from a source, stage it, then write it to a database.

1) Create a new pipeline `gcs_to_bigquery`
2) Add a python data loader that points to gcs 'load_taxi_gcs'
  - I'm going to use the parquet instead of the partitioned data for speed
  - This loads our data from the the indicated bucket and object key
3) add python transformer to standardize column names
  - `@transformer` decorator takes the columns as a string
      - replaces any spaces with underscores `.str.replace(' ', '_')`
      - replaces ensures all characters are lower-case `.str.lower()`\
  - We are skipping the assertion here for funsies.
4) add sql data exporter `write_taxi_to_bigquery` it selects the transformed data and exports it to the `ny_taxy` schema: 
  - BigQuery and default connection
  - `ny_taxi` schema
  - `yellow_cab_data` table
---
##### Parameterized Execution

Sometimes we need to run a pipeline with dependency on a certain parameter (like date).  This is making execution of a pipeline dependent on a variable.  It can be useful when calling data from an api and writing files based on a condition.  In this exercise I built off of a previous pipeline and added a date parameter.

- NOTE!!! We will be cloning a pipeline for this exercise.  However, you must make sure you edit the blocks in a safe way so that the do not get changed in other pipelines.

```python
@data_exporter
def export_data_to_google_cloud_storage(df: DataFrame, **kwargs) -> None:
    # Gets key word argument "execution date"
    now = kwargs.get('execution_date')
    # Formats now to a string in the format year/month/day
    now_fpath = now.strftime("%Y/%m/%d")
    config_path = path.join(get_repo_path(), 'io_config.yaml')
    config_profile = 'default'
    bucket_name = 'claytor-mage'
    # uses fstring to pass our now_fpath 
    object_key = f'{now_fpath}/daily_trips.parquet'
    # Its always a good idea to comment out the last block and check what happens with print first.
    # print(object_key)
    GoogleCloudStorage.with_config(ConfigFileLoader(config_path, config_profile)).export(
       df,
       bucket_name,
       object_key,
    )
```
---
##### Backfills

- **Backfilling** is crucial for filling in missing data or correcting erroneous data in historical pipeline runs.
  - It is particularly relevant for **parameterized pipelines**, where executions depend on variables like dates.

- **Creating Backfills in Mage**
  1. Select the pipeline and specify a date and time window for backfilling.
  2. Set the interval for backfill runs.
  3. Mage automatically creates runs for each date within the specified range, assigning the execution date variable to each run.
---
##### Deploying Mage on GCP with Terraform

- **Deployment Steps**:
  - **Prerequisites**:
    - Terraform
    - G-cloud CLI
  - **Understanding Terraform's Role**: Terraform will be used to deploy an app with Google Cloud Run, create a backend database, and set up persistent storage on Google Cloud.
  - **Configuring Google Cloud Permissions**:
  1. Go to **IAM & Admin** in Google Cloud Dashboard.
  2. Find the service account for Mage deployment.
  3. For broad permissions, set the service account role to **Owner**.
  4. For specific permissions, add:
     - **Artifact Registry Reader**
     - **Artifact Registry Writer**
     - **Cloud Run Developer**
     - **Cloud SQL Admin**
     - **Service Account Token Creator**











  - **Utilizing Mage Terraform Templates**: Use a Mage Terraform template and run `terraform apply` to deploy your Mage instance to the cloud.
